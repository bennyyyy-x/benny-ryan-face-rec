# Benny and Ryan's Face Recognition Tool

This is a simple face recognition tool that uses `MTCNN` to detect and crop faces, and uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize faces using `Tensorflow` and `Keras`. The tool also includes a web interface built with `HTML` and `Express.js` as the backend.

## Installation

This tool requires `Python` and `Node.js` to run. To install the dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```
